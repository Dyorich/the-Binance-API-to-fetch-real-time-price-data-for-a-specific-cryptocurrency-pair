In this script, the get_crypto_price function uses the Binance API to fetch real-time price data for a specific cryptocurrency pair. You can pass the cryptocurrency pair symbol (e.g., "BTCUSDT", "ETHBTC", "BNBBTC") to the get_crypto_price function, and it will return the current price as a float value.

In the example usage, we call get_crypto_price for a specific cryptocurrency pair (crypto_pair = 'BTCUSDT') and print its current price.

This script can be useful for quickly checking the real-time price of a specific cryptocurrency pair on the Binance exchange. You can modify it to use different cryptocurrency pairs or include additional functionality based on the Binance API.

Make sure you have the requests library installed by running the command pip install requests.
